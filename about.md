Hello!

My name is Pawe≈Ç Walczak and I am a software engineer. 

### The Begining

My humble adventure with computer programming started when I was a kid (suprise, suprise!). In the last years of primary school my parents bought me a Computer. Actually, it was a video console Atari XE Game System, but equipped in a keyboard it was fully compatible with Atari XE. Those days in Poland, just after transformation from comunism to capitalism, such machine was a real Thing! Together with my buddies (who had their own Ataries XE) I sinked in the world of 8-bit, 4-colour games. I spent literally hundreds our playing Microsoft Flight Simulator (that's right!).  That was also the time when I first lerned about programming. Atari had it's own programming language: Atari BASIC.
